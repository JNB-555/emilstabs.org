Love this new song!!

 - A Wave of Hope -

Verse

Cm F Cm F Eb (Quickly bounce back and fourth between these chords)
See below for chording

From out of the chaos
A wave appears
In the moonlit confusion
Irons melted
Coming Grace, no longer frozen
The pillow drowns the moans
And shallow breaths
As dancing silvery rays change, each wave eyes a star
And the swollen moon hangs over the water

Reflections guide the way
Gold maze mirrors
As the night wheels turn
Shipwrecks sway, steel mast crashes
Spin green sky

 == Chorus ==

Cm                          F
I have grown my wings, I am flying
Eb                   Bb >   B >
Ascending now, I am soaring
Cm                    F
Untied my wrists, and flew away
Eb                   Bb >   B >
This too shall pass, this too shall pass

 == Bridge ==

G
We are flying, we are flying
         Bb Ab
Over the water
G
We are diving, we are diving
          C#
Into the water

Then Repeat Chorus

[ Now jam over bridge and chorus chords a few times, starting with the bridge ones]

[ Repeat chorus X2 ]

Outro is bridge chords one more time, no singing though.
